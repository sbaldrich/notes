##### Bang Bang

Some bang shortcuts:

* `!!`: execute the last command
* `!foo`: execute the last command that matches *foo*.
* `!foo:p`: print the last command that matches *foo* and put it at the top of the history.
* `!$`: run the last word of the previous command
* `^foo^bar`: run the previous command replacing *foo* with *bar*.
