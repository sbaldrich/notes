### Derivatives

###### Geometric interpretation

The slope of the line tangent to the graph of _f(x)_. However, a tangent line is **not** just a line that meets the graph at one point, it is **the limit of the secant line as the distance between the two points tends to zero**. So the derivative is the limit of the slopes of secant lines _PQ_ as _Q -> P_ (with _P_ fixed).

From this definition, we can extract the formal definition of derivatives:
